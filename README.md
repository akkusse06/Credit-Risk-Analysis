### Nova Bank Credit Risk Challenge
Nova Bank offers personal, medical, education, and business loans across the USA, UK, and Canada. As a Credit Risk Analyst, your mission is to balance fair access with risk control:

- Too lenient → Defaults & losses
- Too strict → Excludes good borrowers

Objective: Analyze 32,582 loan records to:

Identify default patterns (who defaults & why)
Build predictive insights for accurate, unbiased decisions
Optimize lending for profitability + inclusion

Repo Focus: EDA, Visualizations, Correlations, SQL Queries, & Model Prep
Transform data into actionable credit risk strategy! 🚀
